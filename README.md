This website was created in order to serve Rogue Theorycrafting Resources and Simulation results before being extended to every classes.
Simulations are powered by [SimcScripts](https://github.com/Ravenholdt-TC/SimcScripts).

## Development Server

To run a local development server, make sure you have Ruby installed.
You can then install Bundler with:
```
gem install bundler
```

The commands necessary to run the server are:
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you're on Windows, you can just run `devserve.bat` instead and check the site
at `127.0.0.1:4000`.
